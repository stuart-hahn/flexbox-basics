## Introduction

This project is a companion to the YouTube video tutorial titled "Master Flexbox with a Simple Project: A Step-by-Step Guide." The tutorial walks you through building a responsive web layout using CSS Flexbox, explaining each concept and property along the way.

## Project Overview

The project consists of a simple HTML structure styled using CSS Flexbox. The goal is to create a container with several items that are flexibly arranged according to the principles of Flexbox. The layout is fully responsive, adapting to different screen sizes and orientations.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

To work with this project, you'll need:

- A text editor, such as [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
- Basic knowledge of HTML and CSS
- A web browser for testing (Google Chrome, Firefox, etc.)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/flexbox-project-tutorial.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the project directory:**

   ```bash
   cd flexbox-project-tutorial
   ```

3. **Open the project in your text editor:**

   ```bash
   code .
   ```

4. **Open `index.html` in your browser:**

   Simply open the `index.html` file in your web browser to see the project in action.

## Usage

### Exploring the Code

The project is divided into two main files:

- `index.html`: Contains the structure of the web page, including the container and items.
- `style.css`: Contains the CSS rules that style the page and implement the Flexbox layout.

### Modifying the Layout

Feel free to experiment with the Flexbox properties in the `style.css` file. You can:

- Change the `flex-direction` to see how it affects the layout.
- Adjust the `justify-content` and `align-items` properties to control spacing and alignment.
- Add more items to the container and see how `flex-wrap` handles overflow.

This is a great way to deepen your understanding of Flexbox by seeing how small changes impact the overall layout.

## Flexbox Concepts Covered

This project covers the following Flexbox concepts:

- **Flex Container**: Setting up a container as a flex container using `display: flex;`.
- **Main Axis and Cross Axis**: Understanding the main axis (`flex-direction`) and cross axis (`align-items`).
- **Alignment and Spacing**: Using `justify-content` and `align-items` to control the alignment and spacing of items.
- **Flex Wrap**: Allowing items to wrap onto multiple lines with `flex-wrap`.
- **Flex Property**: Controlling the growth, shrinkage, and basis of flex items using the `flex` shorthand property.
